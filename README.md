# Hackathon-2017

  When people keep travelling to different places, they always lack of information about the place they are travelling to. Therefore, this encouraged us for a travel guide mobile application as smartphones are evolving exponentially and aare offering great services to multiple users using GPS navigation, web navigation etc. The tourists will be able to explore many new places just by viewing the updated information in the application. This application uses the current location of the user using Google maps API depending on which the information required (Eg; Restaurants,Events etc) are retrieved and scheduled.
